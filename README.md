# Installation
It is simply, just download the latest Release Version and launch `SubBox.exe`. A new Tab in your browser will open and you are ready to go.
Downloading Videos requires `youtube-dl` and `ffmpeg` but you won't have to care about any of that as `SubBox` will download these on your first launch.
